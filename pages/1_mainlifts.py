Powerlifting revolves around three primary lifts that test an athlete's **absolute strength**. 
Each lift is performed under strict rules and contributes to the lifterâ€™s total score in competition.

    The **squat** is the first lift performed in a powerlifting meet. It involves placing a loaded barbell across the upper back (or front of the shoulders) and squatting down to at least **parallel depth** before standing back up.

    - Tests lower body strength (quads, hamstrings, glutes).
    - Requires strong bracing and balance.
    - Red lights are given if the lifter doesnâ€™t reach depth or racks early.

    The **bench press** is the second lift. The athlete lies flat on a bench, lowers the barbell to their chest, **pauses**, and then presses it back up to full lockout.

    - Tests upper body pushing strength (chest, shoulders, triceps).
    - Requires control, pause, and lockout.
    - Red lights for heaving, uneven lockout, or missed pause.

    The **deadlift** is the final lift and often the most dramatic. The barbell starts on the floor, and the lifter must pull it to a **fully upright position** with locked knees and hips.

    - Tests full-body strength (back, legs, grip).
    - Variants include sumo and conventional stance.
    - Red lights for hitching, ramping, or not locking out.
